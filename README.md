## üõ°Ô∏è About Me  
Hi! I‚Äôm a **Cybersecurity Engineer** and **Offensive Security Enthusiast** currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Cybersecurity at NYU (CGPA 4.0). My expertise spans adversarial emulation, cloud security, cryptographic protocols, and building automated tools to combat emerging threats. I thrive on dissecting vulnerabilities in AI systems, OT networks, and post-quantum cryptography frameworks.  

**What I Do Best**:
- üîç **Penetration Testing**: Full-spectrum red teaming (OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK).
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Development**: Build scalable security tools for threat detection and forensic analysis.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud & DevSecOps**: Secure AWS/GCP environments with automated incident response pipelines.
- üìà **Data-Driven Security**: Design visualization platforms to slash incident response times.
